# market
 ## Yagna Market The Yagna Market is a core component of the Yagna Network, which enables computational Offers and Demands circulation. The Market is open for all entities willing to buy computations (Demands) or monetize computational resources (Offers). ## Yagna Market API The Yagna Market API is the entry to the Yagna Market through which Requestors and Providers can publish their Demands and Offers respectively, find matching counterparty, conduct negotiations and make an agreement.  This version of Market API conforms with capability level 1 of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zny_vfgWV-hcsKS7P-Kdr3Fb0dwfl-6T_cYKVQ9mkNg\"> Market API specification</a>.  Market API contains two roles: Requestors and Providers which are symmetrical most of the time (excluding agreement phase).

* aiohttp

## Getting Started

In your own code, to use this library to connect and interact with market,
you can run the following:

```python
from __future__ import print_function

import time
import market
from market.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://localhost/market-api/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = market.Configuration(
    host = "http://localhost/market-api/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: app_key
configuration = market.Configuration(
    access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with market.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = market.ProviderApi(api_client)
    agreement_id = 'agreement_id_example' # str | 
timeout = 3.4 # float | How many seconds server should wait for new events (0.0 means it should return immediately if there are no events)  (optional)

    try:
        # Approves Agreement proposed by the Reqestor.
        api_instance.approve_agreement(agreement_id, timeout=timeout)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ProviderApi->approve_agreement: %s\n" % e)
    
```
