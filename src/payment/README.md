# payment
 Invoicing and Payments is a fundamental area of Yagna Ecosystem functionality. It includes aspects of communication between Requestor, Provider and a selected Payment Platform, which becomes crucial when Activities are executed in the context of negotiated Agreements. Yagna applications must be able to exercise various payment models, and the Invoicing/Payment-related communication is happening in parallel to Activity control communication. To define functional patterns of Requestor/Provider interaction in this area, Payment API is specified.  An important principle of the Yagna Payment API is that the actual payment transactions are hidden behind the Invoice flow. In other words, a Yagna Application on Requestor side isn’t expected to trigger actual payment transactions. Instead it is expected to receive and accept Invoices raised by the Provider - based on Application’s Invoice Accept notifications, the Payment API implementation orchestrates the payment via a configured Payment platform.  **NOTE: This specification is work-in-progress.** 

The `payment` package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: 1.2.0
- Package version: 1.0.0
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.PythonClientCodegen

## Requirements.

Python 2.7 and 3.4+

## Installation & Usage

This python library package is generated without supporting files like setup.py or requirements files

To be able to use it, you will need these dependencies in your own package that uses this library:

* urllib3 >= 1.15
* six >= 1.10
* certifi
* python-dateutil
* aiohttp

## Getting Started

In your own code, to use this library to connect and interact with payment,
you can run the following:

```python
from __future__ import print_function

import time
import payment
from payment.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://localhost/payment-api/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = payment.Configuration(
    host = "http://localhost/payment-api/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: app_key
configuration = payment.Configuration(
    access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with payment.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = payment.ProviderApi(api_client)
    debit_node_id = 'debit_node_id_example' # str | 
timeout = 60 # float | How many seconds server should wait for acknowledgement from the remote party (0 means forever)  (optional) (default to 60)

    try:
        # Cancel Debit Note.
        api_instance.cancel_debit_note(debit_node_id, timeout=timeout)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ProviderApi->cancel_debit_note: %s\n" % e)
    
```
